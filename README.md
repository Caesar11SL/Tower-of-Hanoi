This is my attempt at Tower of Hanoi. This is my first project, I am excited with what I came up with. This game is designed to move the discs from the leftmost peg to the rightmost peg. There are rules to this game including; you can only move one disc at a time and a bigger disc cannot go on top of a smaller disc. The goal is to complete the game in the minimum amount of moves. I wish you luck for this game. I will be updating soon!

## Technology used
HTML, CSS, Javascript

## STRECH GOALS
I do wish to update this game through out my career. There are a few upgrades I want to add into my code. For example I would want to make this code more DRY and making the website compatible with all devices. As for functional upgrades; adding the ability to select how many discs can be played with, an undo button, and overall a more friendlier look. 
I have included my original wireframe of the vision I had when starting to work on the game.
